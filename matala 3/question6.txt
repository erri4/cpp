first create a matrix of booleans:
pal[i][j] is true if str[i...j] is a palindrom and false otherwise.

then for i from 0 to the length of the given string:
if pal[0][i] is true then dp[i] is 1 because the minimum splits is 0
else, set dp[i] to infinity
for j from 0 to i-1:
if pal[j+1][i] is true, set dp[i] to min{dp[i], dp[j] + 1}

time complexity: O(n^2) because when initializing the matrix `pal` we iterate n^2 time
space complexity: O(n^2) because when initializing the matrix `pal` we save n^2 items
